# Ruby Record Store

This project provides complete CRUD functionality along with routing for a record store that has a one-to-many relationship between `Album`s and `Song`s.

ex)
As a customer, I want to see a welcome page that includes a list of recent Albums and featured Artists.
As a customer, I want to click on an Album to see more information about it.
As a customer, I want to search for an Album by name.
As a business owner, I want to be able to add, update and delete Albums and Artists.

We need to an artist page, and have it populate all the albums for that artist.
We need to make the artist search not case sensitive: The Gooble and the goobles it's two separate bands.
